		<h1>
			<u>About Our Dog Care Services</u>
		</h1>
		<p>PUPcare system came into being as an idea to help people raise
			their pets. CEO & Founder, Harshan Hari has been an avid dog lover
			and a breeder all his life. While working at his developer job, he
			was frequently asked to advise on pet keeping. He identified the
			knowledge gap and thought it would be a great idea to start putting
			this information in the public domain and involve other pet owners to
			share their experiences as well. PUPcare system started as an online
			community that told people to care puppies, breeding and raising pets
			in the Indian context.</p>
